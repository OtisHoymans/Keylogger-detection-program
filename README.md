# 🛡️ Keylogger Detector + Dummy Keylogger (Educational Use Only)

A Python-based keylogger detection tool with a harmless dummy keylogger included for testing and educational purposes. Made by Otis Hoymans, a 2nd year student studying Cloud & Cybersecurity @ Thomas More Geel.

## 📌 Features

### Keylogger Detection:
- Detects suspicious processes based on:
  - Process names and command-line arguments
  - Suspicious directories where keyloggers might reside
  - Heuristic analysis using keylogger-related keywords
- Logs alerts to a file and prints them to the terminal for real-time feedback

### Dummy Keylogger:
- A simple dummy keylogger script to simulate keystroke logging
- Can be used to test the detection tool by generating logs of keystrokes

### Logs:
- Suspicious processes are logged to `logs/detector.log`
- Captured keystrokes from the dummy keylogger are logged to `logs/keylog.log`

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is strictly for educational and testing purposes. DO NOT use the dummy keylogger on any system without proper authorization and understanding of the legal and ethical implications.

## 🧪 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then install the required dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the keylogger
```

```

### 3. Run the detection script
```
python ./detector.py
```

### 4. Check the logs in the logs folder
